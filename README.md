# This is a work in progress

Prp-drone is a FPV drone simulator based off Xinerki's [kgv-drone](https://github.com/Xinerki/kgv-drone) script. We've added a custom animation for the operator for other drone operators to be able to single out enemy operators. Additionally, uses a custom drone model for more realistic appearance. 


**Features:**
- Realistic Drone Model (WIP)
- Explodes on contact (WIP)
- Animation with custom props for operator while in use (WIP)
- Realistic Static and Screen animations


**Dependencies:**
- ox_lib
- ox_inventory (for item use)
